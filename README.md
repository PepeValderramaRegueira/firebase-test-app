# My first React app using Firebase

This application uses some features provided by Firebase, like Authentication, Firebase functions,
Firestore...

The purpose of this is learn Firebase and how to use it to integrate it in my personal
and professional projects, and learn how to do a serverless site.

## What's inside?

* A login and a signup page.
* A page that displays information in real time using Cloud Firestore (I use this page to make a CRUD).
* A profile page (shown when a user is logged in).
